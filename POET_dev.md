## The core idea

POET replaces a standard linear layer

```
y = W · x
```

with a parameterization that keeps `W` **frozen** and instead trains two small
**block-orthogonal** matrices that pre- and post-multiply `W`:

```
y = R_out · W · R_in · x
```

The trainable parameters are the small ones; the big base matrix `W` only
changes at periodic "merge" events. Two random permutations (`P_in`, `P_out`)
get interleaved into the chain to break correlations between blocks:

```
y = P_out · R_out · P_out_inv · W · P_in · R_in · P_in_inv · x
```

This is the math the layer computes every forward pass.

## What `R_in` and `R_out` look like

Both are **block-diagonal orthogonal** matrices built from a small trainable
parameter `oft_R`:

- `oft_R`: a tensor of skew-symmetric block parameters, shape
  `(r_in + r_out, block_size · (block_size − 1) / 2)`, where
  `r_in = in_features / block_size` and `r_out = out_features / block_size`.

For each block, an orthogonal matrix is built via the **Cayley transform**:

```
Q     = skew_symmetric(oft_R_block)    # antisymmetric: Qᵀ = −Q
R_blk = (I − Q) · (I + Q)⁻¹             # orthogonal by construction
```

Assembled along the block diagonal, the `r_in` blocks form `R_in`
(`in × in`), and the `r_out` blocks form `R_out` (`out × out`).
Only the small skew vectors in `oft_R` are trainable.

## Time-scale taxonomy

POET has three nested time scales:

| Quantity        | Changes at            | Period (approx) |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `x` (input)     | every microbatch      | 1 step          |
| `oft_R`         | every `optimizer.step` | 1 cycle (K microbatches) |
| `R_in`, `R_out` | derived from `oft_R`  | every cycle     |
| `W` (base)      | merge events          | every `merge_period` cycles |
| `perm_in`, `perm_out` | merge events    | every `merge_period` cycles |

This structure is what makes caching effective — `R` is constant across the
K microbatches of a gradient-accumulation cycle.

## The merge step

Every `merge_period` cycles (default 200), `merge_then_reinitialize` runs:

1. Fold the current `R_in`, `R_out` into `W`:
   `W := P_out · R_out · P_out_inv · W · P_in · R_in · P_in_inv` (the
   "effective" weight at this point).
2. Reset `oft_R` to zero, so `R_in = R_out = I`.
3. Randomize `perm_in`, `perm_out`.
4. Pre-permute `W` with the new perms (`perform_permutation`) so subsequent
   forwards produce the same effective math.

After merge, training continues with new random perms, fresh `oft_R = 0`,
and the same trainable surface area.

## Per-microbatch forward (current default kernel)

A single fused Triton kernel, `chain_layer_x_checkpoint_mem_o2`, performs
the full chain:

1. Load `x` via `perm_in_inv` (index translation, no buffer)
2. Block-diag multiply `x @ R_in` (one block at a time)
3. Re-index via `perm_in`
4. Dense matmul `@ W` (the bulk of the FLOPs)
5. Re-index via `perm_out_inv`
6. Block-diag multiply `@ R_out`
7. Store via `perm_out`

The "checkpoint_mem_o2" suffix means the kernel does internal **gradient
checkpointing** — it doesn't store the intermediates from steps 2–6 for
backward; instead it recomputes them on demand. This trades extra compute
for activation memory savings.

## Backward

The backward pass propagates gradients of the loss through the kernel, all
the way back to `oft_R` via the Cayley graph. The flow is:

```
∂L/∂y  →  chain_layer backward  →  ∂L/∂R_in, ∂L/∂R_out
                                              ↓
                                    Cayley backward
                                              ↓
                                         ∂L/∂oft_R
                                              ↓
                                  Megatron's main_grad buffer
                                  (fp32 accumulator across K microbatches)
```

Across K microbatches in a cycle, the gradient accumulates in fp32 via
Megatron's `main_grad` mechanism. After K microbatches, `optimizer.step()`
updates `oft_R`, and the cycle starts over.

## Cayley cache (Mode A)

Because `oft_R` is **constant within a cycle**, the Cayley-derived
`R_in` and `R_out` are **identical for every one of the K microbatches**.
Computing them K times is redundant.

Mode A (in `src/optim/poet_cache.py`) caches them:

- **Cache miss** (first microbatch of a cycle): build `R_full` with the
  Cayley autograd graph alive, detach into `R_leaf` tensors used by the
  layer's forward.
- **Cache hit** (microbatches 2..K): just return the cached `R_leaf`
  tensors. Skip the Cayley work.
- **Flush** (end of cycle, before `optimizer.step()`): run one manual VJP
  through the cached Cayley graph (`R_full → oft_R`), pushing the
  K-accumulated `R_leaf.grad` back to `oft_R.main_grad`. Then invalidate
  the cache so the next cycle rebuilds with the updated `oft_R`.

Speedup ceiling: `1 / (1 − cayley_fraction × (K−1)/K)`. For small attention
projections (1536²) at K=64 in bf16 this is ~1.20×. For big FFN layers
(7168²+) it's ~1.03×.

## Hyperparameters worth knowing

| Parameter | Typical value | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `block_size` | 256 or 512 | Size of each Cayley block. Bigger = more orthogonal freedom per block, more compute, bigger speedup ceiling for Mode A. Must divide both `in_features` and `out_features`. |
| `merge_period` | 200 steps | How often `R` is folded into `W` and `oft_R` reset. |
| `init_type` | `normalized` | Whether to normalize `W` rows at init (per-row spectral norm). |
| `mup_alpha` | 1.0 | μP-style spectral scaling. |
| `cache_mode` | `cached_fwd_bwd` (Mode A) or `none` | Whether to use the Cayley cache. |

## 2.1 Implemented modifications — status & verdict

| Modification | Config key / CLI flag | What it changes (mechanism) | Status | Verdict @ 60m/40tpp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frozen-W block-orthogonal core | always on | `y = R_out·W·R_in·x`; train only the small skew `oft_R`, fold into `W` at merges | ✅ | baseline (POET) |
| Single-step merge + decoupled reinit | `merge_period=1`, `reinit_period` (`poet0`) | fold `R→W` every step; `reinit_period` separately controls Ψ-resample / Adam-momentum reset | ✅ | helps vs `merge_period=400` (≈3.65 vs ≈3.70+) |
| Lie-algebra momentum on Q | `optim.poet.q_optimizer=lie_algebra` / `--poet-q-optimizer` (`poet_lie`) | Adam-like 1st/2nd moment kept in the skew algebra so(n), persists across merges ([poet_lie_momentum.py:161](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_momentum.py#L161)) | ✅ | **helps** (3.647 vs vanilla 3.70) — the strongest POET base |
| Stage-2 W-free RMS scaling | `optim.poet.lie_rms=true`, `lie_rms_c` / `--poet-lie-rms[-c]` (`poet_lie_rms`) | per-block `α = c·√blk / (‖A‖_F+eps)` → dimension-consistent rotation angle, no `W` access ([poet_lie_momentum.py:161-171](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_momentum.py#L161-L171)) | ✅ | **helps with tuned lr** (3.626 @ lr 3e-3, c=4) — best of the *RMS* family; superseded by `lie_ortho` ↓ |
| **Muon-like orthogonalizing Q-opt** | `optim.poet.q_optimizer=lie_ortho`, `lie_ortho_c`/`_method`/`_ns_steps` (`poet_lie_orth`) | standalone `LieOrthMomentum`: same Lie 1st-moment momentum, but **orthogonalize** the skew direction (all planes → ~same angle) instead of RMS-scaling; `muon` band (~5 NS steps) or `spectral` exact `A(−A²)^{-1/2}` (~20) ([poet_lie_orth.py:27](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_orth.py#L27)) | ✅ | **BEST POET / best PEFT** (**3.5231** @ lr **4e-3** / scale 0.5 / c8 → **eff∠ 0.016**, head-OFF + `lie_alternating`, `ghsu7t8y`) — **beats muon_kimi 3.5321 by −0.009** but now **+0.030 behind re-tuned dense adam** (**3.4935** @ lr 3e-3, `ebndt1qj`); the 2026-06-09 grid found a hotter optimum (angle 0.016 > old 0.012, dense lr 4e-3 > 3e-3). Prior champ 3.5332 @ eff∠0.012 (`1ynrrimu`) |
| DP-sharded `lie_ortho` orthogonalization | `optim.poet.lie_ortho_distributed=true` / `--poet-lie-ortho-distributed` | round-robin the Newton-Schulz skew blocks across data-parallel ranks, then re-sync with one zero-padded `all_reduce(SUM)` of update deltas | ✅ | perf-only win: completed distributed run matches replicated quality (3.566695 vs 3.566730) and is faster (0.2785 vs 0.3764 s/step); now `true` in all POET experiment configs |
| Head-aligned attention rotation | `optim.poet.head_aligned_attn=true` / `--poet-head-aligned-attn` (`poet_lie_head`, `poet_h_*`) | swap q/k/v/o to `HeadAlignedPOETLinear`: per-head block-diagonal rotation (block=head_dim, fixed identity Ψ), needs unfused qkv ([head_aligned_layer.py:28](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/third_party/poet_torch/head_aligned_layer.py#L28), [poet_layers.py:245-257](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_layers.py#L245-L257)) | ✅ | **neutral→hurts** at 60m (3.654 vs non-head 3.634 at matched lr/c) |
| Residual-side perm off | `optim.poet.head_resid_perm=false` / `--poet-no-head-resid-perm` (`poet_h_noperm_*`) | freeze the residual (non-head) side's Ψ in head-aligned mode | ✅ | neutral (3.6536 vs 3.6541) |
| Alternating single-sided update | `optim.poet.lie_alternating=true`, `lie_alternate_every` (`poet_lie_alt`) | write only ONE rotation side per step (out even / in odd) but keep BOTH Lie momenta advancing every step ([poet_lie_orth.py](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_orth.py)) | ✅ | **optimizer-dependent: HELPS `lie_ortho` (champion 3.5332 → tuned to 3.5231 by the lr×scale×c grid, ~4% faster/step), but HURT `lie_algebra`** (3.709 vs 3.647). Needs fresh both-side momentum — the d³-optimized true-single-side (frozen momentum) regresses to 4.22 (`au92x0pj`) |
| Nesterov look-ahead (`lie_ortho`) | `optim.poet.lie_ortho_nesterov=true` / `--poet-lie-ortho-nesterov` | orthogonalize the Muon look-ahead direction `(1−b1)·g + b1·m` (= modern Muon's `grad.lerp(m, β)`) instead of the bare first moment `m`; skew/rotation branch only, AdamW untouched ([poet_lie_orth.py:160-176](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_orth.py#L160-L176)) | ⏳ implemented, **untested** | sweep ready ([sweep_lie_orth_nesterov_lr.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_nesterov_lr.sh)), no run yet @ 60m/40tpp |
| `exp` parameterization | `optim.poet.parameterization=exp` | exact matrix-exponential orthogonal map (vs truncated Cayley); incompatible with caching | ✅ | **hurts** vs cayley (3.70–3.82) |
| Muon-on-Q (SkewMuon) | `optim.poet.q_optimizer=muon`, `muon_theta/ns_steps/momentum` | per-block Newton-Schulz orthogonalize + constant-angle θ rescale; built for the no-reset regime ([poet_skew_muon.py:120](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_skew_muon.py#L120)) | ✅ | hurts so far (≈3.79); needs `merge_period=0` tuning, not yet done |
| Cayley cache (Mode A) | `optim.poet.cache_mode=cached_fwd_bwd` | cache `R` within a grad-accum cycle, flush one VJP at cycle end ([poet_cache.py](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_cache.py)) | ✅ | perf-only; measured dead-end for small K (no quality effect) |
| Normalized / μP base init | `optim.poet.init_type`, `mup_alpha` | row-normalize frozen `W` (+ optional μP spectral scale) ([poet_layers.py:44-62](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_layers.py#L44-L62)) | ✅ | `normalized` is default; not separately ablated (sweeps fixed `mup_alpha=1.0`) |
| Single-sided rotation (freeze output) | `optim.poet.train_output_rotation=false` / `--poet-freeze-output-rotation` | train only `R_in`, freeze `R_out=I` | ✅ | not ablated at scale |

Q-optimizer dispatch (`lie_algebra` / `lie_ortho` / `muon` / default `adam`) lives in [poet.py](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet.py); `lie_algebra` and `lie_ortho` share the same builder, which branches to construct `LieOrthMomentum` at [poet.py:596](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet.py#L596). CLI→flag routing in [megatron_args.py](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/utils/megatron_args.py).

**The `lie_ortho` optimizer (new — current best POET).** A standalone `LieOrthMomentum` ([poet_lie_orth.py:27](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/src/optim/poet_lie_orth.py#L27)), selected by `optim.poet.q_optimizer=lie_ortho`. It keeps the same Lie-algebra **first-moment** momentum on `oft_R` as `lie_algebra` (persists across folds), but replaces the direction→generator transform: instead of RMS-scaling, it **orthogonalizes** the per-block skew direction so **every rotation plane turns by ~the same angle** — Muon's "trust the subspace, not the per-direction magnitude" bet, applied to *rotational* updates. Two methods (`optim.poet.lie_ortho_method`):
- **`muon`** (default, ~5 NS steps): Muon's quintic Newton–Schulz on the direction, then a `½(X−Xᵀ)` cleanup. NS *preserves skew* on a skew input (verified to ~1e-15) and lands the singular values in a **band** around 1 — cheap, approximately-equal angles.
- **`spectral`** (~15–20 NS steps): the exact Löwdin form `A·(−A²)^{-1/2}` — drives every σ to *exactly* 1, ≈4× the cost.

Realized per-plane angle = `lr · scale · ortho_c` (under `muon` the band makes `ortho_c` *nominal*, ≈0.75–1.0× that). First-moment-only by default (a second moment is partly undone by orthogonalization). Design doc: [docs/muon_orthogonalizing_optimizer_poet.md](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/docs/muon_orthogonalizing_optimizer_poet.md); plan: [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-poet-lie-orth-optimizer.md](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-poet-lie-orth-optimizer.md). **Status (2026-06-09):** champion is now **`ghsu7t8y`** (`cos_lr4_s50_c8`) at **val/loss 3.5231** — the head-OFF + `lie_alternating` recipe with the angle/dense-lr tuned UP by the 2026-06-09 lr×scale×c grid (**lr 4e-3 / scale 0.5 / c8 → eff∠ 0.016**). This **beats muon_kimi (3.5321) by −0.009** (best PEFT method), but a re-tuned **dense adam at lr 3e-3** (`ebndt1qj`, **val/loss 3.4935**) now leads overall by **−0.030** — so POET is the best PEFT/non-dense method at 60m/40tpp, not the outright best (see §2.3). It supersedes the prior POET champion `1ynrrimu` (3.5332 @ lr3e-3/eff∠0.012), which the grid reproduced exactly (`li3sflwl`, `wj68pgey`). It beats the **head-aligned-OFF both-sides** run `dwynpk9y` (c=8, lr 3e-3, muon, **`head_aligned_attn=false`**, `lie_ortho_distributed=true`) at **3.5528** by **−0.020**. Both wins compound: turning head-alignment OFF beat the head-on twin `7lncmww7` (3.5667) by **−0.014** and overtook the old adam baseline (3.557, lr 1e-3 — but the re-tuned adam at lr 3e-3 = 3.4935 now leads overall); alternating then added **−0.017–0.020** more. The earlier head-on champion `7lncmww7` matched its replicated twin `l5w0n7gq` to ~3e-5 while cutting W&B `perf/step_time_s` from **0.3764 → 0.2785**; the nohead champion runs at a comparable **0.2822 s/step**. Relative to the pre-speedup tracker baseline (1.180 s/step), the current path is ~4× faster end-to-end, and the targeted optimizer hot path was confirmed ~3× faster on GPU. Full sweep verdicts are in §2.5; headline: **ortho ≫ RMS** (matched-angle RMS sibling diverged), **muon-band ≈ exact `spectral`**, **1st-moment > 2nd**, **the angle sweet spot is eff∠ ~0.016** (head-OFF+alt tolerates higher angles than the old 0.012 ceiling; only eff∠ 0.024 diverged), **dense lr wants 4e-3 ≳ 3e-3** (decoupling-down falsified), **min_lr_ratio 0.01 is the floor sweet spot** (0.1 and 0.001 both slightly worse), and **head-alignment OFF > ON even with ortho**. The DP-sharded path round-robins the Newton-Schulz work across data-parallel ranks and re-syncs with one zero-padded `all_reduce(SUM)` of update deltas; it is now enabled in all POET experiment YAMLs (effective for `q_optimizer=lie_ortho`, no-op at `dp_world=1`). Sweeps: [_lr](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_lr.sh), [_scale](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_scale.sh), [_variants](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_variants.sh), [_c](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_c.sh) (the c-sweep traces the same effective-angle axis as `_scale`), [_nesterov_lr](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_nesterov_lr.sh) (champion recipe + Muon Nesterov look-ahead, lr {1,2,3,4,6}e-3 — **untested**).

## 2.2 Experiment configs (the variants)

All under [configs/experiments/optim/](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/). Common to all POET configs: `block_count=1`, `scale=0.5`, `init_type=normalized`, `parameterization=cayley`, `train_output_rotation=true`, `lie_ortho_distributed=true` (effective only when `q_optimizer=lie_ortho`).

| Config | q_opt | merge / reinit | lie_rms (c) | head-aligned | alternating | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [poet](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet.yaml) | adam | 400 / 0 | — | no | no | Baseline POET (periodic merge) |
| [poet0](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet0.yaml) | adam | 1 / 400 | — | no | no | Single-step merge, Ψ/momentum held for 400 steps |
| [poet_lie](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet_lie.yaml) | lie_algebra | 1 / −1 | — | no | no | Pion **Stage 1**: Lie-algebra momentum, never resample Ψ |
| [poet_lie_alt](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet_lie_alt.yaml) | lie_algebra | 1 / −1 | — | no | yes (every 1) | Stage 1 + §6 alternating single-sided update |
| [poet_lie_head](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet_lie_head.yaml) | lie_algebra | 1 / −1 | — | **yes** | no | Stage 1 + per-head attention rotation |
| [poet_lie_rms](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet_lie_rms.yaml) | lie_algebra | 1 / −1 | true (0.2) | no | no | Pion **Stage 2**: W-free RMS angle scaling |
| [poet_lie_orth](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/configs/experiments/optim/poet_lie_orth.yaml) | **lie_ortho** | 1 / −1 | — (ortho c=4, muon) | yes (YAML default) | no | **Muon-like orthogonalizing** optimizer (equal-angle planes) — **current best POET**, but the best run overrides `head_aligned_attn=false` (head-off wins, see §2.5) |

The `poet_h_*` / `poet_dense_*` runs in §2.4 are CLI sweeps over `poet_lie_rms` (± `head_aligned_attn`, varying `lie_rms_c`), not separate config files.

## 2.3 Results — which designs are useful

Best completed run per setting, ranked by `val/loss` (60m / 40 tokens-per-param):

**Conclusions (what's useful):**
- **Re-tuned dense adam (lr 3e-3) now LEADS overall — POET is the best PEFT method but no longer the outright best.** A fine-grained adam lr sweep found **lr 3e-3 → val 3.4935** (`ebndt1qj`, ppl 32.90), a **−0.064** jump over the old adam baseline (3.5570 @ lr 1e-3) that beats the best POET (3.5231) by **−0.030** and muon_kimi (3.5321) by **−0.039**. The earlier "POET is outright best" headline was an artifact of comparing tuned POET against an under-tuned (lr 1e-3) dense baseline; with matched lr, dense adam is strongest. ⚠️ adam ran with cosine **min_lr_ratio 0.1** (not POET's 0.01) and has not been swept on min_lr / 2–3 seeds yet.
- **POET is still the best PEFT method and the strongest non-dense optimizer — it just lost the overall crown.** Best POET (poet_lie_orth + `lie_alternating`, head-OFF, distributed, **lr 4e-3 / scale 0.5 / c8 → eff∠ 0.016**) hits **val 3.5231** (`ghsu7t8y`), still **beating muon_kimi (3.5321) by −0.009** and the prior champion (3.5332 @ lr3e-3/eff∠0.012) by −0.010, but now **+0.030 behind dense adam**. The POET-internal stack that got here: head-OFF (−0.014) → `lie_alternating` (−0.017) → **tune the angle up to ~0.016 + dense lr up to 4e-3 (−0.010)**. ⚠️ single seed; worth a 2–3 seed confirm.
- **The optimum rotation angle is ~0.016, not 0.012 — the old champion was under-rotating.** The grid's top three (3.5231 @ eff∠0.016, 3.5274 @ 0.018, 3.5288 @ 0.012/dense-4e-3) all beat the 0.012 champion. And **dense lr wants to be HIGHER**: at fixed eff∠0.012, dense 4e-3 (3.5288) > 3e-3 (3.5332), and the decoupling sweep is monotone — lowering dense lr to 1e-3 *hurt* (3.5332→3.5563). The earlier decoupling hypothesis (3e-3 too hot) is **falsified**: POET wants it hot on both axes.
- **Alternating the single-sided write HELPS `lie_ortho` (reversing the `lie_algebra` verdict).** Writing one rotation side per step while keeping **both** momenta fresh is the new champion (3.5332, ahead at every checkpoint, ~4% faster/step). This *flips* the earlier finding that alternating hurt the `lie_algebra` family (3.709 vs 3.647) — the difference is the optimizer: orthogonalized updates take a full-magnitude step along the momentum *direction*, so giving each side a 2-step-accumulated (smoother) momentum + Gauss–Seidel one-factor-at-a-time decoupling is a net win; under RMS/`lie_algebra` it was not. Crucial caveat: this only works while **both momenta stay fresh** — the d³-optimized true-single-side variant (which *freezes* the inactive momentum to skip its gradient) **regresses to 4.22** (`au92x0pj`). Fresh both-side momentum is load-bearing.
- **Orthogonalizing the rotation direction (`lie_ortho`) beats RMS-scaling it (`lie_rms`)** — now confirmed by the variants sweep: at the matched champion angle the RMS sibling `lierms_c8` **diverged** (val 6.38) while ortho held 3.567. Also from the sweeps: **muon-band ≈ exact `spectral`** (3.5669 vs 3.5703 — the cheap ~5-step quintic is enough, no need to pay for exact σ=1), **1st-moment beats 2nd** (3.5669 vs 3.5702), and for the angle **c=8 ≳ c=4** (3.5669 vs 3.5715). The `head`-on/off arm (`lieorth_c8_nohead`) is now resolved — **head-off wins** (3.5528 vs head-on 3.5667).
- **The useful POET stack** is *single-step merge + Lie-algebra momentum + an angle-equalizing transform + alternating write*: vanilla `poet` (≈3.70) → `poet_lie` (3.647) → `poet_lie_rms` (3.619) → `poet_lie_orth` (3.5528, head-off) → **+ `lie_alternating` (3.5332)**, all with **lr 3e-3**.
- **The rotation-angle ceiling is RECIPE-DEPENDENT and moved up — best is now eff∠ ~0.016.** The old "ceiling at 0.012, 0.018 diverges (val 4.55)" was the **both-sides head-ON** recipe. For the current **head-OFF + alternating** recipe, eff∠ **0.016 (lr4/s0.5/c8 = 3.5231) and 0.018 (lr3/s0.5/c12 = 3.5274) are stable AND best**; only **eff∠ 0.024 (lr4/s0.5/c12) diverged**. Alternating writes one side/step, so each side rotates less per step → a higher *nominal* angle is tolerable. New sweet spot ≈ 0.016; ceiling sits between 0.018 and 0.024. (c and scale remain interchangeable under `muon`: it's the product eff∠=lr·scale·c that matters.)
- **The `c` knob has a sweet spot:** for RMS, c≈4 best at lr 3e-3 (c=8 *diverged* at this lr); for ortho c=8 ≳ c=4 and the band is wider. Larger c over-rotates.
- **Head-aligned attention does NOT help — now confirmed for the ortho family too.** The `lieorth_c8_nohead` arm finished: head-OFF `dwynpk9y` **3.5528** beats the head-ON twin `7lncmww7` **3.5667** by **−0.014** at the otherwise-identical champion recipe. This matches the RMS evidence (lr 3e-3/c=4: head `l2pzawa4` 3.6335 vs no-head `98293d1u` 3.6193; and lr 1e-3/c=8: head 3.654 vs dense 3.634). So head-alignment hurts across **both** families — the best POET is now head-OFF.
- **`exp` parameterization and (reset-regime) Muon-on-Q are current regressions.** Muon-on-Q (SkewMuon) was built for the `merge_period=0` no-reset regime and hasn't been retuned for it. (Alternating is NO LONGER a regression — it is the new champion under `lie_ortho`; see the alternating bullet above.)

## 2.4 Head-aligned + RMS sweep (the `poet_h_*` / `poet_dense_*` runs)

All at lr 1e-3, `lie_rms_c` swept (the `aNNN` token in run names is the paired nominal-angle annotation, **not** `mup_alpha`, which stayed 1.0). Sorted best-first by `val/loss`:

| Run | head-aligned | lie_rms_c | resid_perm | val/loss | train |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| poet_dense_rms_c8_a004 | no | 8 | — | 3.6344 | 3.5367 |
| poet_dense_rms_c12_a006 | no | 12 | — | 3.6576 | 3.5617 |
| poet_h_noperm_rms_c8 | yes | 8 | off | 3.6536 | 3.5578 |
| poet_h_rms_c8_a004 | yes | 8 | on | 3.6541 | 3.5588 |
| poet_h_rms_c12_a006 | yes | 12 | on | 3.6743 | 3.5810 |
| poet_h_rms_c4_a002 | yes | 4 | on | 3.6781 | 3.5815 |
| poet_h_norms | yes | — (no rms) | on | 3.6927 | 3.5949 |
| poet_h_exp_rms_c8 | yes | 8 (exp) | on | — | crashed @ step 4256 |

Takeaway: **non-head-aligned (`dense`) beats head-aligned at every matched c**, RMS-on beats RMS-off, c=8 > c=12 > c=4 for the head-aligned family, and the `exp` head-aligned run crashed.

## 2.5 lie_ortho sweep results (as of 2026-06-08)

Champion-quality setting (**updated 2026-06-09**): **lr 4e-3, scale 0.5, c=8** (eff∠ **0.016**), muon, **head-aligned OFF**, **+ `lie_alternating=true`**, cosine min_lr 0.01. Current best completed run is `cos_lr4_s50_c8` (`ghsu7t8y`) = **val/loss 3.5231** — **beats muon_kimi 3.5321** — found by the lr×scale×c grid (arm **F** below). The prior champion `1ynrrimu` (lr3e-3/eff∠0.012) = 3.5332 is arm **E**. The head-off **both-sides** run `dwynpk9y` = **3.5528** (the `lieorth_c8_nohead` arm — head-off beats head-on by −0.014; fresh both-sides rerun `f4f49v4f` = 3.5504). Among the *head-aligned* arms, the original anchor `5sbgancm` = **3.5669**, reproduced 4× (`lieorth_c8_muon`, `lieorth_lr0.003`, `lieorth_scale0.5`, + the original anchor), with the distributed rerun `7lncmww7` = **3.5667**.

**Speed/distributed status:** cached skew indices + same-block batching removed the big Python/scatter overhead, and DP-sharded orthogonalization is now wired end-to-end. Completed same-config pair:

| Run | distributed | val/loss | train | s/step | runtime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `7lncmww7` | true | **3.566695** | 3.4693 | **0.2785** | 3070s |
| `l5w0n7gq` | false | 3.566730 | 3.4680 | 0.3764 | 3949s |

Quality is unchanged at the 60m/40tpp level; the distributed path gives a clear perf win on top of the optimizer speedup. Completed sweep arms, by sweep:

**A — global LR** ([sweep_lie_orth_lr.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_lr.sh)): 1e-3 → 3.6259 · 2e-3 → 3.5683 · **3e-3 → 3.5669** · (4e-3, 6e-3 not yet complete). Peak at 3e-3 so far.

**B — POET scale / rotation-lr** ([sweep_lie_orth_scale.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_scale.sh)): 0.25 → 3.5715 · **0.5 → 3.5669** · **0.75 → 4.5527 (DIVERGED)** · (1.0, 1.5 incomplete). Stability ceiling at scale 0.5 (eff∠ 0.012).

**C — variants at the champion angle** ([sweep_lie_orth_variants.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_variants.sh)):

| arm | change vs control | val/loss |
|---|---|---|
| `lieorth_c8_muon` (control) | — | 3.5669 |
| `lieorth_c8_spectral` | exact σ=1 (ns=20) | 3.5703 |
| `lieorth_c8_2mom` | second moment on | 3.5702 |
| `lierms_c8` | RMS instead of ortho | **6.3797 (DIVERGED)** |
| `lieorth_c8_nohead` | head-aligned off | **3.5528 (BEST — `dwynpk9y`)** |

→ muon-band ≈ exact spectral; 1st-moment ≥ 2nd; **ortho far more stable than RMS** at this angle; **head-aligned OFF wins** (3.5528 vs head-on 3.5667 — head-alignment hurts the ortho family too).

**D — native c** ([sweep_lie_orth_c.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_c.sh)): not yet run. Degenerate with sweep B (eff∠ = lr·scale·c, and `orthogonalize(−m)` is magnitude-free), so c≥12 (eff∠ ≥ 0.018) will likely diverge like scale=0.75; the informative band is c≤8–10.

**E — alternating single-sided write** (champion recipe + `lie_alternating=true`, `lie_alternate_every=1`):

| arm | change vs both-sides control | val/loss | s/step |
|---|---|---|---:|
| both-sides head-off (`f4f49v4f`) | — | 3.5504 | 0.2150 |
| **alternating, both momenta (`1ynrrimu`)** | write 1 side/step, both momenta fresh | **3.5332** (then-best; superseded by grid arm F → 3.5231) | **0.2068** |
| true-single-side (`au92x0pj`) | write 1 side/step, **freeze** inactive momentum (d³-skip layer `single_step_x_alternating`) | 4.2201 (REGRESS) | 0.1923 |

→ Alternating the *write* while keeping **both momenta fresh** is the champion (−0.017 vs both-sides, ahead at every checkpoint, ~4% faster). Freezing the inactive momentum to also skip its gradient (the d³-optimized layer) **breaks** it — the fresh both-side momentum is the load-bearing ingredient. This run was a CLI override on `poet_lie_orth` (no dedicated config yet); a dedicated `poet_lie_orth_alt` config + a POETX-structured alternating layer are planned.

**F — lr × scale × c grid** ([sweep_lie_orth_grid_cosine.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_grid_cosine.sh), cosine min_lr 0.01, champion base): 16 cells = lr {1,2,3,4}e-3 × scale {0.25,0.5} × c {8,12}. **This grid produced the new overall best.** Top cells (val/loss; eff∠ = lr·scale·c):

| run | lr | scale | c | eff∠ | val/loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`cos_lr4_s50_c8` (`ghsu7t8y`)** | 4e-3 | 0.5 | 8 | **0.016** | **3.5231 🏆** |
| `cos_lr3_s50_c12` (`owcyd976`) | 3e-3 | 0.5 | 12 | 0.018 | 3.5274 |
| `cos_lr4_s25_c12` (`q60mrt7u`) | 4e-3 | 0.25 | 12 | 0.012 | 3.5288 |
| `cos_lr3_s50_c8` (`li3sflwl`, = champ) | 3e-3 | 0.5 | 8 | 0.012 | 3.5332 |
| `cos_lr2_s50_c12` | 2e-3 | 0.5 | 12 | 0.012 | 3.5385 |
| `cos_lr4_s50_c12` | 4e-3 | 0.5 | 12 | 0.024 | **DIVERGED** |

→ **eff∠ 0.016 is the new sweet spot** (0.018 close behind); the curve trains *hotter* (higher loss mid-run) but anneals to a lower endpoint, ahead from step ~8.5k on. **0.024 diverged** → ceiling for this recipe is between 0.018 and 0.024 (vs the old 0.012 ceiling for the both-sides head-on recipe). At fixed eff∠ 0.012, dense lr **4e-3 (3.5288) > 3e-3 (3.5332)** — hotter dense helps. Monotone below: lower lr/angle steadily worse (down to 3.7875 @ eff∠ 0.002).

**G — dense-LR decoupling** ([sweep_lie_orth_decouple.sh](/lustre/fast/fast/zqiu/slm-research/scripts/sweep_lie_orth_decouple.sh), cosine): hold c=8 and the rotation-group lr (eff∠) fixed, push AdamW dense lr 3e-3→1e-3 via scale, × min_lr_ratio {0.01, 0.001}. **No winner — three clean monotone trends, all "POET wants it hot":**
- At fixed eff∠ 0.012 (m01): dense 3e-3 (3.5332) < 2e-3 (3.5385) < 1.5e-3 (3.5432) < 1e-3 (3.5563). **Lowering dense lr HURTS** → decoupling-down hypothesis falsified; the high dense lr is *good*.
- eff∠ 0.012 > 0.008 at every dense lr (e.g. dense 3e-3: 3.5332 vs 3.5565).
- **min_lr_ratio 0.01 > 0.001** for all 8 twins (deeper floor slightly hurts). Combined with `9mvs5hsg` (cosine min_lr 0.1 = 3.5413), **0.01 is the floor sweet spot** (0.1 and 0.001 both worse).

**Schedule (settled):** **cosine beats WSD.** Matched-recipe WSD df0.2 (`lodwi7cw`) = 3.5699, **+0.037 vs cosine** — holding the angle at the ceiling through the stable phase keeps loss high and the 20% tail can't recover; WSD→cosine as df→1 so it can't win here. min_lr 0.01 cosine (champ) beats min_lr 0.1 cosine (`9mvs5hsg` 3.5413) by +0.008.

The "POET is outright best" headline was an artifact of an under-tuned (lr 1e-3) dense baseline. ⚠️ single seed, and adam has not been swept on min_lr (POET's best used 0.01); worth a 2–3 seed confirm.

## 2.7 How to update this tracker

- **Cohort matters:** only compare runs at the same scale + tokens/param. Everything above is 60m / 40tpp. A 300m or 20x table would be a separate block.
- **Pull results** from each run's W&B summary: `runs/<dir>/**/wandb-summary.json`, keys `val/loss` / `train/loss` / `val/ppl` / `_step`. Treat `_step < 9000` as crashed/short for this cohort (full run = 9155 steps).
- **Settings** come from `runs/<dir>/resolved_config.yaml` (`optim.lr`, `optim.poet.*`, `training.tokens_per_param`).
- **Data-quality caveats from this snapshot:** the vanilla `poet` family had a high crash rate (many `_step ≪ 9155`); duplicate rows in the raw scan are same-setting reruns (e.g. the two `poet_lie_rms` lr-3e-3/c-4 dirs); `poet_h_exp_rms_c8` crashed at step 4256.
